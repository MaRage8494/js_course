# Data structures operators

[13.07.2023] Today i start new chapter, GLHF👏

## Destructuring Arrays

In this lecture i met with _array destructuring_ - its when big data structure separate on smaller data structures like a variable ✅
I learn all features with this theme and ready to go next lecture 🏁

## Destructuring Objects

In this lecture theme has continued and now it's about objects. For me, the main different consists of brackets: if array square brackets [], if object curly brackets {} (use switch-case for optimization!!!😁) 🏁
