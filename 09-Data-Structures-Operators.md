# Data structures operators

[13.07.2023] Today i start new chapter, GLHF👏

## Destructuring Arrays

In this lecture i met with _array destructuring_ - its when big data structure separate on smaller data structures like a variable ✅
I learn all features with this theme and ready to go next lecture 🏁

## Destructuring Objects

In this lecture theme has continued and now it's about objects. For me, the main different consists of brackets: if array square brackets [], if object curly brackets {} (use switch-case for optimization!!!😁) 🏁

## The Spread Operator (...)

[14.07.2023] Oh, today was a very productive day. Two very interest and useful themes.
In the first lecture i met with spread operator. He allow to separate elements in arrays, strings, maps, sets and objects ✅
Also this tool can join two and more arrays, copy array and to separate array for arguments function 🏁

## Rest Pattern and Parameters

It's second useful theme which simillar in syntax, but absolutely oppositely in his destination. Rest groups all other elements in array, string and etc. ✅
I finally found very usefull thing: for the argument we can use rest parametr AND we get ubility to use in argument any quantity parameters. With rest we can for the sake of argument use arrays (with spread) and common variables 🏁

## Short Circuting (&& AND ||)

[15.07.2023] Today i met with new opetators, i will not use them in future because this operators get the code more heavy for read ☠

Operator || - return first truthy argument ✅
Operator && - return first falsy argument or last if all elements is true 🏁

## The Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)

Operator ?? - it's simmilar like a || operator but for him 0 and '' it's thuthy elements 🏁

## Logical Assigment Operators

It's well-known operators like '+=', but with use new operators ||, && and ?? 🏁

## Coding Challenge #1

[18.07.2023] Today i spend all time for this challenge BUT i randomly does a coding challenge #4 😁 In future i will planed solve this again with new knowledges, but now you can see how i solve this how ✅

[19.07.2023] Today i finally done the correct challenge😁🏁

## Looping Arrays: The For-of Loop

This loop very simillar with for each loop in other languages(Java, Python etc.) and so i end this lecture very fast 🏁

## Enhanced Object Literals

This lecture was about a new features that came from ES6 and nowadays. In general, this small lifehacks for your code, no more 😓 🏁
