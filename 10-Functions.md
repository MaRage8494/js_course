## How Passing Arguments Works: Value vs Reference

If we pass object like an argement, JS create a clone this object, but when we change something in clone, this also change in parent object 🏁

## First-Class and Higher-Order Functions

In this lecture i lerned what is it a First-Class and Higher-Order functions and also their differences 🏁

## Functions Accepting Callback Functions

[29.07.2023] I saw High-Order function on action😁🏁

## Functions Returning Functions

It's very weird, but i think it's usefull (i hope😁) 🏁

## The call and aplly Methods

Oh, this very useful methods, but i will use only ✨*call*✨ 🏁

## The bind Method

[13.08.2023] Happy birthday to me 🥳 Time for continue my work.
How i understood the bind method better than call or apply methods. This methods allow create a new function based on previous functions and we can set deffault parameters in this function 🏁

## Coding Challenge #1

Not hard challenge, but i can't understood what i must be done. When i look in walkthrought i understood and done it fast🏁

## Closures

[14.08.2023] Today i learn very useful thing, it's _closures_!!! I know this theme very popular in job interview🔥 I understood closures very fast, for me it's common thing 🏁

## Coding Challenge #2

Oh, it's easiest coding challenge ever 🏁

## Conclusion

Это секция была быстрой, но очень полезной. Хотелось бы по-больше челленджей или проектов, а то одна теория как то не оч😢
